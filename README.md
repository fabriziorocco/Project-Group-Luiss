Text of the problem.

SheldonAir is an emerging airline in the airline business.
Dr. Cooper, the CEO of SheldonAir, would like to know the minimum number of legs (flight segments) required to go from one cityto another city. 
This problem can be represented by an undirected graph where:
-vertices correspond to cities where SheldonAir is operating
-an edge between two vertices corresponds to a direct SheldonAir flight between the two corrisponding cities.
In other terms, given two vertices u and v, you are required to compute the length of a shortest path between u and v (i.e., the minimum number of edges in a path from u to v). 
Design and implement an algorithm for solving this problem. 
Test your algorithmon different datasets
